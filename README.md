# HaikuBot

This is my first Python project. It creates a haiku using random words from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary at http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict.
Words are cross-checked for vulgarity using the dataset at https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words.
Have a nice day!
